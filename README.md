**To-Do List Project**

This is a simple to-do list project built using the following technologies:

1. React
2. Node.js
3. MongoDB
4. Express
5. GraphQL
6. Tailwind CSS

**Project Structure:**

The project consists of two folders: frontend and backend.

1. Frontend: Contains the code for the user interface of the to-do list application built with React.
2. Backend: Contains the server-side code responsible for handling requests, interacting with the database, and implementing the GraphQL API using Node.js.

**Instructions to Run the Project:**

To run this project on your PC or laptop, follow these steps:

1. Download the frontend and backend folders to your local machine.


2. Start by running the backend server first.
   - Open the backend folder using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) .
   - In the terminal, first run the command `npm install` to install required node modules and then run command `npm start` to start the backend server.
    This will initiate the server, allowing it to listen for incoming requests.


3. Next, run the frontend application.
   - Open the frontend folder using VS Code .
   - In the terminal, first run the command `npm install` to install required node modules and then run command `npm run start`.
     This will launch the application in your default browser.
     You can now interact with all the frontend and backend functionalities of the website.
     

**Note:** Ensure that you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system before running the project.
